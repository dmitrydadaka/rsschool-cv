##About myself##

In my first education I am a lawyer. In the process of working as a lawyer, I realized that this profession does not give me satisfaction. Therefore, over time, I decided to change my profession and become a software engineer. Graduated from the faculty of retraining of the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. Unfortunately, the course curriculum was not up to date. I had to self-study and take free courses. I hope that my efforts were not in vain and that I will receive a job offer.
